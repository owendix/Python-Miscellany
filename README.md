# Python-Miscellany
Miscellaneous Python programs using various modules such as SciPy, NumPy, and PyPlot


countNumAsWords: write numbers as words, count the letters, convert this to words, and repeat toward stability.

slideEstSnowBowl: I lost control at Arizona Snowbowl and slid down the mountain. This is how far (from GPS data) an oblate spheroid model and superimposed variations in altitude.

unJumbler: simple tools I wrote for fun for unjumbling a word in Python:
  unJumble: unjumbles a word with a brute force method (slow for long words)
  visuallyUnJumble: write all permutations of possible first and last letters so you can possibly see the solution(s) more easily. This seems mildly helpful.
  myWord: initialize visuallyUnJumble with a word and see if you can solve it by comparing to the result from unJumble
